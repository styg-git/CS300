# CS300 - Data Structures and Algorithms

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The problems that I faced in this course was figuring out the best way to store and organize data using various methods. We sort things into categories every day, but it's not often that you really sit down and thing about the structure of that mental organization. The problem that this course forces you to think about is exactly how information should be laid out for processing and practical application.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

This course definitely challenges your logical capacity and makes you really consider how to efficiently structure data for practical applications within a programming language. I view data structures and algorithms as tools designed for specific applications. I watch a lot of programming YouTubers that teach Leetcode techniques and things of that sort, and they all make a similar point on a regular basis: learning the patterns and where these tools are best used is one of the biggest parts of understanding this topic. Now that I have some experience working with these sorts of problems, approaching more technical interview prep like Leetcode seems much more achievable as I know it is really important for the job searching process.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

There are a ton of resources out there for learning data structures and algorithms. I did a huge amount of Googling, watching YouTube videos, and having AI explain concepts to me in the form of metaphors and analogies when I was getting really stuck. Sometimes keeping a piece of scrap paper handy to just map out what I was learning when approaching linked lists and hash tables with chaining was helpful to conceptualize what was going on "under the hood." The patterns in ZyBooks made figuring out how to build the data structures much easier the first time, and being able to go back to the reference materials helped me get out of being stuck several times. Finally, there is a SNHU Computer Science discord server where you can ask questions and engage with other students that I have found very helpful when encountering issues.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

To be completely honest, I was intimidated by this topic until about week 5. I found myself spending much more time trying to understand the content because it is an unusual way to think about data. I believe that this course really expanded the way that I think about programming and has given me confidence that I can begin utilizing more complex techniques such as sorting algorithms and custom data structures. The final project was a valuable learning experience - I approached it by using one of my previous milestones (the Hash Table one) and my pseudocode from Project 1 to start building out a hash table that could take in data and organize it.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I spent a ton of time working on input validation and making sure that my data structure was very clean, maintainable, and efficient. This is the first project where I have really put in the time to try to keep the inputs very clean to the point where the user cannot make a mistake without being redirected. I think the only input validation that I didn't include was duplicate detection when reading .csv files which is something I have been thinking about since I completed the project.
